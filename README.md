# Useful information during the Hackathon

We want to provide you a fast and short overview on the available IBM Cloud resources for you, during the hackathon.

## 1) How to prepare?

Blog post: [Today I want to address a common situation for developers: You want to participate in a hackathon, and you plan to use IBM Cloud, but you have never used it before. How to prepare?](https://suedbroecker.net/2019/02/11/how-to-prepare-for-a-hackathon-with-ibm-cloud/)

Technologies: Kubernetes, Node-RED, Cloud Foundry and Watson Services

* You can get a feature code from http://cognitiveclass.ai

## 4) Useful getting started resources from the Call for Code challenge

These kits have been created for the Call for Code COVID-19 challenge, but can be helpful for the Hackathon:

**Crisis communications** starter kit: https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/getstarted/covid-19/crisis-communication/

In times of crisis, communications systems are one of the first systems to become overwhelmed. Chatbots help respond to tens, even hundreds, of thousands of messages a day. COVID-19 has prompted many people to seek answers about symptoms and testing sites as well as the current status of schools, transportation, and other public services. Using Watson Assistant, this Call for Code starter kit has designed a virtual assistant pre-loaded to understand and respond to common questions about COVID-19, scan COVID-19 news articles using Watson Discovery, and respond to COVID statistics inquires with data from trusted sources.

**Remote education** starter kit https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/getstarted/covid-19/remote-education

Itâ€™s imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.
